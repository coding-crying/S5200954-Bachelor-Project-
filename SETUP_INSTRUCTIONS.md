```

## üîß Setup Requirements

### 1. Neo4j AuraDB Setup

The system requires a Neo4j AuraDB instance. If you're getting authentication errors:

1. **Verify Neo4j Credentials**: Check that your `.env.local` file has correct credentials
2. **Database Access**: Ensure the Neo4j instance is running and accessible
3. **User Permissions**: Verify the user has admin privileges to create constraints

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env.local` contains:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Neo4j AuraDB Configuration  
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_password
```

### 3. Initialize the System

Once Neo4j is properly configured:

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Initialize the database schema**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/neo4j/setup
   ```

3. **Access the language learning system**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000?agentConfig=languageLearning
   ```

## üéØ How to Use the System

### 1. User Onboarding Flow

1. **Introduction Agent (Lingo)** welcomes the user
2. User provides:
   - Display name
   - Native language
   - Target language to learn
3. System creates user profile in Neo4j
4. Routes to appropriate introduction agent based on experience

### 2. Language Assessment

- **New Language Intro (Nova)**: For complete beginners
- **Existing Language Intro (Max)**: For users with prior knowledge
- Both agents assess level and transfer to AI tutor

### 3. Conversational Learning with AI Tutor (Carlos)

- **Context-Aware**: Carlos knows user's vocabulary knowledge and progress
- **SRS Integration**: Naturally incorporates vocabulary due for review
- **Real-time Processing**: Every utterance is analyzed and stored
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Adjusts based on user's demonstrated knowledge

## üß† Key Features Implemented

### Real-time Linguistic Analysis
- **GPT-4.1-mini Integration**: Processes utterances for linguistic features
- **Lemmatization**: Extracts base forms of words
- **POS Tagging**: Identifies parts of speech
- **Translation Mapping**: Creates relationships between languages
- **Vocabulary Extraction**: Identifies new words for learning

### Spaced Repetition System (SRS)
- **SM-2 Algorithm**: Optimizes review intervals based on performance
- **Automatic Item Creation**: New vocabulary automatically added to SRS
- **Performance Tracking**: Monitors user progress and adjusts difficulty
- **Status Management**: Tracks learning stages (new ‚Üí learning ‚Üí learned)

### Neo4j Data Model
- **Users**: Profile and language preferences
- **Conversations**: Complete conversation history
- **Utterances**: Individual messages with speaker identification
- **Lexemes**: Vocabulary items with linguistic properties
- **SRS Items**: Spaced repetition data for each vocabulary item
- **Relationships**: Complex connections between all entities

### AI Tutor Capabilities
- **Personalization**: Uses Neo4j data to customize responses
- **Vocabulary Integration**: Naturally incorporates due vocabulary
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitors and celebrates learning milestones
- **Error Correction**: Gentle, natural correction of mistakes
- **Cultural Context**: Provides cultural insights alongside language learning

## üîç Testing the System

### Manual Testing
1. Navigate to the language learning interface
2. Go through the complete user flow
3. Test conversation with the AI tutor
4. Verify vocabulary is being tracked

### API Testing
Use the provided test script:
```bash
node test-language-learning-stack.js
```

### Database Verification
Check Neo4j browser to see:
- User nodes created
- Conversation and utterance data
- Lexeme extraction
- SRS item creation

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Neo4j Connection Issues
- Verify credentials in `.env.local`
- Check Neo4j instance is running
- Ensure user has proper permissions
- Test connection with Neo4j browser

### API Errors
- Check server logs for detailed error messages
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Ensure all required environment variables are set

### Agent Transfer Issues
- Verify all agents are properly imported
- Check agent relationship configuration
- Ensure transfer tools are injected correctly

## üéâ Success Indicators

When properly set up, you should see:

1. ‚úÖ **Schema Initialization**: Constraints and indexes created successfully
2. ‚úÖ **User Creation**: New users stored in Neo4j with language relationships
3. ‚úÖ **Utterance Processing**: Conversations analyzed and stored with linguistic data
4. ‚úÖ **SRS Functionality**: Vocabulary items created and updated based on performance
5. ‚úÖ **AI Tutor Integration**: Carlos provides personalized responses using Neo4j data

## üìà Next Steps

Once the system is running:

1. **Test the complete user journey** from introduction to conversational learning
2. **Monitor Neo4j data** to see linguistic analysis results
3. **Experiment with different languages** to test multilingual capabilities
4. **Review SRS performance** to see vocabulary learning optimization
5. **Customize agent personalities** and teaching approaches as needed
