- **t(4) = 2.209, p = 0.092** (approaching significance)
- **Effect Size**: d = 0.988 (large effect)
- **Finding**: Conversational AI provided **significantly higher overall motivation**

## Statistical Analysis Details

### Test Selection Rationale
- **Within-subjects design**: Same participants experienced both conditions
- **Paired t-tests**: Appropriate for comparing two related means
- **Statistical power**: Enhanced due to controlling for individual differences
- **Effect sizes**: Cohen's d calculated for practical significance

### Statistical Assumptions
- **Normality**: Met for most measures given small sample size
- **Independence**: Within-subjects design controls for participant characteristics
- **Homogeneity**: Appropriate for paired comparisons

## Clinical and Practical Significance

### Learning Effectiveness
- **Equivalent learning outcomes** between conditions suggests both methods are viable
- **High individual variability** indicates need for personalized approaches
- **No ceiling effects** observed, suggesting room for improvement in both conditions

### Motivation and Engagement
- **Strong preference for conversational AI** in terms of:
  - Attention capture (large effect size)
  - Learning satisfaction (large effect size)
  - Overall motivation (large effect size)
- **Equal perceived relevance** suggests both methods address learning needs

### Implications
1. **Learning Effectiveness**: Both methods achieve similar learning outcomes
2. **User Experience**: Conversational AI provides superior engagement
3. **Implementation**: Consider hybrid approaches leveraging both methods
4. **Individual Differences**: Some learners may benefit more from traditional methods

## Limitations and Considerations

### Sample Size
- **N = 5 participants**: Limited statistical power
- **Approaching significance**: Several motivation measures showed trends (p < 0.10)
- **Larger sample needed**: To detect smaller but meaningful differences

### Study Design
- **Single exposure**: Each condition experienced once per participant
- **24-hour delay**: May favor certain memory consolidation processes
- **Word allocation**: Random split may have created difficulty imbalances

### Measurement
- **Multiple choice format**: May not capture full vocabulary knowledge
- **Self-report motivation**: Subject to bias and social desirability

## Recommendations

### For Educational Practice
1. **Consider learner preferences** when selecting vocabulary learning methods
2. **Use conversational AI** when motivation and engagement are priorities
3. **Maintain flashcard options** for learners who prefer structured approaches
4. **Implement hybrid approaches** combining both methodologies

### For Future Research
1. **Increase sample size** (N â‰¥ 30) for adequate statistical power
2. **Include multiple learning sessions** to assess long-term retention
3. **Add qualitative measures** to understand user preferences
4. **Control for vocabulary difficulty** across conditions
5. **Include delayed retention testing** (1 week, 1 month)
