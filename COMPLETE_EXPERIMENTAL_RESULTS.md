2. **Superior motivation** with conversational AI may lead to better long-term engagement
3. **Individual differences** highlight need for adaptive learning systems

### For Learning Design
1. **Consider learner preferences** when selecting instructional methods
2. **Hybrid approaches** may optimize both learning and motivation
3. **Attention and satisfaction** are key differentiators for conversational AI

### For Future Research

## 9. Conclusions

### Primary Findings
1. **Learning Effectiveness**: Both conversational AI and flashcards achieved similar vocabulary learning outcomes
2. **Motivation Superior**: Conversational AI provided significantly higher motivation, particularly in attention capture and learning satisfaction
3. **Individual Variation**: Substantial individual differences suggest need for personalized learning approaches

### Theoretical Implications
- **Motivation ≠ Performance**: Higher motivation did not translate to significantly better learning in this short-term study
- **Engagement Value**: Conversational AI's strength lies in user experience rather than immediate learning gains
- **Method Complementarity**: Both approaches have unique strengths that could be combined

### Practical Recommendations
1. **Use conversational AI** when motivation and engagement are primary concerns
2. **Maintain flashcard options** for learners who prefer structured approaches
3. **Consider hybrid implementations** that leverage strengths of both methods
4. **Assess individual preferences** before selecting instructional method
