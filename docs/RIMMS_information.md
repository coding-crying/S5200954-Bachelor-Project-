# RIMMS (Reduced Instructional Materials Motivation Survey)

## Overview

The RIMMS is a 12-item shortened version of the original 36-item Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) developed by John Keller. It is based on the ARCS model of motivational design.

## Structure

**12 items total**: 3 items per dimension
- **Attention** (3 items)
- **Relevance** (3 items) 
- **Confidence** (3 items)
- **Satisfaction** (3 items)

## Response Scale

5-point Likert scale:
- 1 = Not True
- 2 = Slightly True
- 3 = Moderately True
- 4 = Mostly True
- 5 = Very True

## ARCS Dimensions

### Attention
Measures whether the instructional materials capture and maintain learner interest

### Relevance  
Measures whether the materials are perceived as relevant to learner goals and needs

### Confidence
Measures whether learners feel confident they can succeed with the materials

### Satisfaction
Measures whether learners are satisfied with their learning experience

## Psychometric Properties

- **Reliability**: Cronbach's Î± typically > 0.80 for each subscale
- **Validity**: Confirmed 4-factor structure through CFA
- **Advantages**: More efficient than 36-item IMMS while maintaining construct validity

## Usage in Experimental Design

For vocabulary learning experiment:
- Administer RIMMS for **Conversational Condition**
- Administer RIMMS for **Flashcard Condition**  
- Calculate **difference scores** for analysis
- Use **paired t-tests** to compare engagement between conditions

## Note for Researchers

**The exact 12 items are not publicly available** in open access sources. To obtain the validated RIMMS items, you need to:

1. **Contact original authors** (Loorbach et al., 2015)
2. **Check institutional subscriptions** to British Journal of Educational Technology
3. **Use alternative approach**: Select highest-loading items from original 36-item IMMS

## Alternative: Construct Your Own Short RIMMS

Based on ARCS principles, create 3 items per dimension focusing on:

**Attention Items:**
- Materials captured my attention
- Materials were visually/auditorily engaging
- Materials kept me interested throughout

**Relevance Items:**  
- Materials were relevant to my learning goals
- Materials related to my needs/interests
- Materials were useful for me

**Confidence Items:**
- I felt confident I could learn with these materials
- Materials helped me feel capable of success
- I felt able to master the content

**Satisfaction Items:**
- I was satisfied with my learning experience
- Materials met my expectations
- I enjoyed learning with these materials
