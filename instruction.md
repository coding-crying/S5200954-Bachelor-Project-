# Experimental Instructions (1-Minute Script)

You'll learn 20 vocabulary words using two methods across four 6-minute blocks. 

**Flashcard Method:** Use the buttons to show definitions and example sentences. Control your own pace.

**Conversational AI Method:** This is real-time and adaptive. Key points:
- Say "I want new words" to learn new vocabulary
- Say "I want to review words" to practice what you've learned  
- You can interrupt the AI anytime - don't wait for it to finish
- Give it feedback if you don't like how it's teaching
- It understands natural language and is competent

After blocks 3 and 4, you'll complete brief motivation surveys. Tomorrow you'll receive a multiple-choice test via email.

Both methods are equally valid - this compares learning approaches, not your ability. Focus on learning the words and interact naturally with the AI system.
